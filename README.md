# Overview

Cabin Fright is a first-person horror game I made to learn game design and implement programming in C++. I wanted to learn how to make something more interactive with moving around, turning on lights, and adding sounds.

In the game, you are in a dark cabin at night. You can walk around with the WASD keys, look around with the mouse, and use your flashlight by pressing "F" to turn it on and off. The sounds, music, and lighting add to the suspense and make the game more intense.
